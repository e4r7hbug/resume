# Basic Website
This is the pile of code meant to be my website. It's actually slightly responsive thanks to `flexbox` modeling! If you didn't notice, it's my resume for now, but will evolve!

## Colouring Scheme
Using mrmrs/colors

## Building

Use [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to create a Virtual Environment
with the required Packages.

```bash
pip install pipenv

pipenv install
pipenv shell

(resume) ./render.py
```
